# National-Hockey-League-San-Jose-Sharks-Performance-Analysis
This exploratory data analysis project was conducted on data sourced from Kaggle specifically for the 2010s' decade. As I am originally from San Jose, CA, I wanted to look into the Sharks' record as they've been a relatively new West Coast team with strong performance over the years and also have had some bad luck. Overall they've had several playoff appearences, but why hasn't the Stanley Cup been won in San Jose yet?
