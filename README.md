# National-Hockey-League-San-Jose-Sharks-Performance-Analysis
This exploratory data analysis project was conducted on data sourced from Kaggle specifically for the 2010s' decade. As I am originally from San Jose, CA, I wanted to look into the Sharks' record as they've been a relatively new West Coast team with strong performance over the years and also have had some bad luck. Overall they've had several playoff appearences, but why hasn't the Stanley Cup been won in San Jose yet?

The RDBMS used was MySQL and minimal data cleaning/editing was needed on the data. The data set includes NHL playoff data from 1918-2022. I mainly focused on running queries between the years 2010-2019 while looking into what made the Sharks successful against other teams and what has been the cause of their bad luck in some years. Overall, I wanted to prove that the franchise has been consistently strong with above-average performance however Eastern League teams have somehow always been more dominant.
